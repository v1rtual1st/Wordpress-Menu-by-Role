# Wordpress-Menu-by-Role
Remove or show admin menu items based on role.


Edit and input code from menu_init.php to the functions.php
- change label to your own role within 'code'

If having problems removing custom menu items added by plugins use code from debug_menu_items.php (also function.php)
- it will output menu init -> look for parameter from the second indes (eg. [2] => wpcf7 )
